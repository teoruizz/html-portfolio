<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Leader!!! There are several things that a leader has to accomplish. I am in the path of becoming a great leader.</p>

<p>I started my career as a Business Manager to then becoming a Master in Project Management. 
  I sincerily think that was what changed everything for me. i have always been passionate about techonology and stuff, 
  but once I became a Project Manager for the technology industry I became addicted to learning about web projects.
  Offcourse as a Project Manager I am not completely involved in the technical stuff but I didn't mind that. 
  I asked about the code, I reviewed the files I could and sometimes I made a couple developers furious because 
  of a disaster caused by unexperienced hands.
</p>

<p>Right now, I am a leader in the making but I keep my passion about learning to code and trying to integrate 
  my leadership abilities into every role I perform.
